> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Implementing data synchronization across multiple devices was a challenge that I solved by using Firebase Firestore 
to ensure seamless syncing of user data, preventing data loss and enhancing the user experience. To overcome the 
challenge of learning new technologies outside the class syllabus, I took the initiative to learn and implement 
Firebase Firestore for the backend and customized the UI for a more personalized experience, exceeding the project's 
requirements. For designing a user-friendly interface, I focused on simplicity and customization, ensuring that users 
could personalize their app experience without being overwhelmed by complexity.

> ## Lessons Learned

I gained proficiency in Java and Android Studio for mobile app development and learned how to use Firebase Firestore 
to efficiently sync data across multiple devices. I also improved my skills in creating intuitive and customizable user 
interfaces. By learning new technologies and successfully implementing them in the project, I exceeded expectations and 
enhanced the overall app experience.
