> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Integrating advanced frameworks like ARKit, Core Motion, and Speech Recognition into a cohesive user experience 
was a challenge, which I overcame by leveraging Swift’s modular design and careful architecture to ensure smooth 
interactions. Ensuring AR functionality across various devices required extensive testing on iOS and iPadOS devices, 
where I fine-tuned ARKit parameters for consistency. Navigating the App Store submission process was another hurdle, 
which I addressed by strictly following Apple’s guidelines, ensuring the app met all criteria, and using TestFlight 
for thorough pre-release testing.

> ## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I mastered advanced Apple frameworks like ARKit, Core Motion, and Game Center to create 
interactive and educational content, while gaining valuable insights into app deployment and the App Store submission 
process. I also improved my skills in designing cohesive user experiences that integrate diverse technologies and 
learned the importance of thorough testing and compliance with platform guidelines for a successful app launch.
