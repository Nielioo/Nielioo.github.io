</blockquote>

- **Frontend**: SwiftUI
- **API Integration**: Alamofire for fetching real-time currency data from the Currency API.
- **Development Tools**: Swift, Xcode, App Store Connect

> ## Features

### Real-Time Currency Conversion

Fetches and displays the latest exchange rates using the Currency API.

### Intuitive Interface

A clean and straightforward design built with SwiftUI for ease of use.

### Multi-Currency Support

Allows conversion between a wide range of global currencies.

### Lightweight and Fast

Optimized performance to provide quick results without unnecessary load times.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Handling real-time data fetching and API integration was addressed by using Alamofire for reliable API calls, 
implementing robust error handling for network issues, and ensuring efficient data parsing. Designing a user-friendly 
interface for diverse users was achieved by leveraging SwiftUI's declarative syntax to create an intuitive, 
responsive, and accessible UI. Navigating the App Store submission process involved carefully following Apple's 
guidelines, meeting all requirements, and conducting thorough pre-release testing through TestFlight.

> ## Lessons Learned

I developed expertise in integrating real-time data APIs using Alamofire, gained a deeper understanding of SwiftUI 
for creating responsive and user-friendly UIs, and acquired valuable experience in the complete app deployment lifecycle, 
from development to App Store publication. Additionally, I strengthened my problem-solving skills by effectively handling 
API errors and optimizing app performance.
