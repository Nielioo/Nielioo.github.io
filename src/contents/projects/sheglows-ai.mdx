> ## Features

### Facial Analysis

Users can upload or take a photo of themselves for AI-based analysis. The app provides detailed insights into facial characteristics such as:

- Undertone, skin type, and skin tone
- Eye shape, face shape, and eye color
- Hair color and more

Based on the analysis, the app generates personalized makeup tips with step-by-step instructions and product recommendations.

### AI Chat Beauty Coach

The app features an interactive chat system, where users can ask questions and receive advice about:

- Boosting confidence and enhancing beauty
- Skincare routines for clear skin
- Outfit recommendations and "glow-up" tips
- And everything beauty-related

### Referral System and In-App Purchases

Users can unlock premium features through in-app purchases or gain free access by using a referral code system.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

SheGlows AI was my third project at Saclic Studio, and unlike my previous experiences, I developed this app entirely 
from scratch. Building a project independently required me to take ownership of every aspect, from designing the UI/UX 
to implementing advanced features like facial analysis and the AI chat system. The most challenging part was creating an 
intuitive and user-friendly interface while ensuring that the backend systems, including the referral system and in-app 
purchases, worked seamlessly. By maintaining a disciplined workflow, utilizing my growing expertise in Flutter and Dart, 
and seeking guidance when needed, I overcame these challenges and successfully delivered the project.

> ## Lessons Learned

Working on SheGlows AI solidified my confidence as a developer capable of managing an entire project independently. 
I deepened my understanding of integrating AI-driven features with mobile applications and learned how to create robust 
systems for user engagement, such as the referral system and chat functionality. This project taught me the importance of 
balancing aesthetics with functionality, making it one of the most rewarding experiences in my career.
