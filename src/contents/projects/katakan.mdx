> ## Short Explanation

Katakan is an iOS app designed to help children with speech delays communicate more clearly through interactive 
speech recognition and engaging visuals.

> ## Project Goals

The primary objectives of Katakan were:

- To provide an accessible and engaging tool for children with speech delays to practice and 
improve their communication skills.
- To design a user-friendly interface and visually appealing assets tailored for young learners.
- To integrate speech recognition technology for real-time feedback on speech exercises.

   </div>
</blockquote>

- Frontend: SwiftUI
- Data Management: CoreData
- APIs & Frameworks: SpeechRecognizer for speech input and analysis.
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design, Adobe Illustrator for creating app assets.
- Development Tools: Xcode

> ## Features

### Speech Recognition

Real-time feedback using SpeechRecognizer to help children practice clear articulation and improve their speech.

### Interactive Visual Design

Custom-designed assets created in Adobe Illustrator to provide a friendly and engaging user experience.

### Progress Tracking

CoreData integration to save user progress and track improvements over time.

### Intuitive UI
A child-friendly interface designed in Figma to ensure ease of use for young users and their guardians.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Implementing accurate speech recognition for children's unique speech patterns was addressed using the 
SpeechRecognizer framework, extensively tested with diverse samples to fine-tune accuracy. Designing 
child-friendly assets and an intuitive UI involved collaborating with designers to create vibrant 
visuals in Adobe Illustrator and prototyping layouts in Figma for usability. For managing and storing 
user progress efficiently, I utilized CoreData to enable seamless tracking of achievements and milestones.

> ## Lessons Learned

I enhanced my proficiency in integrating CoreData and SpeechRecognizer to build functional app features 
while gaining experience in designing visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces using Figma and 
Adobe Illustrator. Through iterative testing, I learned to optimize speech recognition for children's varied 
speech patterns and deepened my understanding of the development lifecycle for specialized educational apps, 
including critical UX considerations for young audiences.
