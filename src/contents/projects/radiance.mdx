> ## Features

### Multi-Platform Support

Radiance is available on both web and mobile platforms, providing flexibility for students to play and learn anywhere.

### Custom API Integration

A custom API was created to ensure seamless data synchronization between the website and mobile apps.

### Educational Gameplay

Designed to engage and educate high school students with challenging tasks and activities suitable for their learning level.

### Responsive UI/UX

The interface is designed to be user-friendly on both web and mobile, ensuring a smooth experience for students.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Synchronizing data between the website and mobile apps was a challenge that I addressed by developing a custom 
API to manage data sharing across platforms, ensuring consistency and real-time updates. Designing separate UIs for 
both web and mobile apps required creating responsive layouts using Bootstrap for the web and Java for mobile, optimizing 
the user experience for each platform. To coordinate with team members and integrate different components smoothly, 
I organized regular meetings for clear communication and used version control systems to facilitate collaboration.

> ## Lessons Learned

I gained proficiency in Laravel and PHP for backend development and developed skills in API design and integration 
for multi-platform synchronization. I also improved my ability to create responsive, platform-specific UI/UX designs 
and learned the importance of teamwork and clear communication in completing a large-scale project. The project earned 
me a full score, providing a strong sense of accomplishment and pride.
