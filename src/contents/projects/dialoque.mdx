> ## Short Explanation

Dialoque is a multi-platform app designed to help children learn English vocabulary, available on iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS, using engaging features like speech recognition and gamification.

> ## Project Goals

The key goals for Dialoque were:

- To develop an interactive learning platform that helps children expand their English vocabulary.
- To integrate speech recognition, haptic feedback, and game mechanics to enhance user engagement.
- To publish a seamless multi-platform app (iOS, iPadOS, watchOS) and ensure smooth deployment on the App Store.

> ## Features

### Vocabulary Practice
An interactive feature that helps children learn and practice English vocabulary through voice recognition and haptic feedback.

### Multi-Platform Support

Seamless experience across iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS, allowing children to continue their learning on any Apple device.

### Progress Tracking

Game Center integration to track progress, achievements, and provide motivational feedback.

### Widget Support

WidgetKit implementation for quick vocabulary practice directly from the home screen.

### CloudSync

CloudKit support for syncing progress across devices, ensuring continuity in learning.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Integrating various platforms (iOS, iPadOS, watchOS) into a cohesive experience was a challenge, which I overcame 
by using SwiftUI to design a responsive UI that adapts to multiple device form factors and screen sizes. Managing 
local data and syncing it across devices was addressed by utilizing CoreData for local storage and CloudKit for 
seamless syncing, ensuring data consistency. Ensuring speech recognition accuracy for children’s voices was a 
challenge, which I solved by implementing SwiftSpeech and fine-tuning the app’s sensitivity to varied pronunciations. 
Finally, to develop an engaging yet educational app, I incorporated gamification elements through Game Center and 
Core Haptics, making the app both fun and educational.

> ## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained expertise in SwiftUI for multi-platform development, ensuring a unified experience 
across devices, and deepened my understanding of CoreData and CloudKit for efficient data management and synchronization 
in a cloud-based environment. I also enhanced my skills in integrating speech recognition into interactive applications 
and gained valuable experience with app deployment on the App Store, addressing platform-specific requirements.
