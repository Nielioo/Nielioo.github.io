> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Structuring the database for efficient data management was addressed by designing a normalized database with 
clear relationships between franchises and branches, ensuring smooth data handling. To ensure clean and maintainable 
code, I followed Laravel's conventions and best practices, using controllers and views effectively to make the code 
easy for future developers to understand. Balancing user-friendliness with functionality was achieved by using Bootstrap 
to design a clean, responsive UI, making it easy for both users and administrators to navigate and manage franchise 
information.

> ## Lessons Learned

I gained proficiency in Laravel and PHP for backend web development and learned how to efficiently structure databases 
to manage related data. I emphasized the importance of clean, maintainable code to enhance readability and future-proof 
the project. Additionally, I improved my skills in building responsive web applications using Bootstrap.
