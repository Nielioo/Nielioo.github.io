> ## Short Explanation

ASPRA Network is a website that employs a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to manage 
various business operations. It incorporates MySQL for robust data storage and integrates the 
WhatsApp API for real-time notifications. The project follows the waterfall software development model, 
ensuring a structured and systematic approach.

> ## Project Goals


This project was created to streamline business processes by providing a centralized platform where users can:

- Manage roles and permissions to ensure secure access.
- Organize and oversee products and machines efficiently.
- Create and handle internal orders, including their approval and verification processes.
- Schedule and manage job orders (SPK) seamlessly.
- Generate detailed production reports for better decision-making.
- Receive real-time notifications via WhatsApp API for approvals and alerts.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

During the development of ASPRA Network, I faced challenges such as managing complex 
user roles and permissions, handling large datasets efficiently, and ensuring real-time 
communication for approvals and alerts. 

To address these, I implemented role-based access control, 
optimized MySQL database design, and integrated the WhatsApp API for automated notifications. 
Additionally, I focused on creating an intuitive user interface with Tailwind CSS and Livewire, 
ensuring the platform was user-friendly and responsive. Following the waterfall model helped keep 
the project organized and aligned with its goals.

> ## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained proficiency in Laravel, Tailwind CSS, and Livewire for building dynamic 
web applications, while mastering the MVC architecture for better code organization. I also improved my 
skills in MySQL database management, API integration for enhanced user communication, and project management 
by effectively applying the waterfall development model.
