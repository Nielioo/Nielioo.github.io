> ## Short Explanation

DaMovie is a mobile app that offers comprehensive and up-to-date movie information, pulling data automatically 
from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It was developed using Android Studio.

> ## Project Goals

The main objectives of DaMovie were:

- To create an intuitive mobile app for users to explore movie data such as titles, release dates, genres, and ratings.
- To implement real-time content updates by integrating TMDb API for fetching movie data.
- To develop the app using Android Studio and learn how to efficiently integrate an API into an Android project.

- Mobile Development: Android Studio
- API Integration: Retrofit
- Data Source: TMDb API

> ## Features

### Movie Database Integration

The app pulls data from the TMDb API, providing users with up-to-date movie details, including genres, ratings, release dates, and summaries.

### Real-Time Data Updates

Movie information is refreshed automatically through the integration with the TMDb API, ensuring the app displays the latest content.

### Intuitive UI

Designed with an easy-to-navigate interface, allowing users to quickly search and explore movies.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Working with a large and complex API was a challenge that I overcame by using Retrofit to handle API requests 
efficiently, ensuring data was fetched and displayed properly without overloading the app. To ensure smooth data 
integration and presentation, I focused on organizing data parsing and UI rendering to prevent delays and maintain a 
seamless user experience. For handling real-time data updates, I implemented automatic updates to ensure users always 
had the latest movie information, optimizing both data handling and display performance.

> ## Lessons Learned

I gained hands-on experience with Retrofit for API integration in Android and learned how to work with large APIs 
like TMDb, processing complex data effectively. This project enhanced my skills in Android Studio, particularly in 
managing real-time data updates and optimizing mobile app performance.
