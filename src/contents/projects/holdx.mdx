> ## Short Explanation

**HoldX** is a science-backed mobile app developed to help users break free from harmful digital habits—particularly 
porn addiction—by promoting self-control, daily mindfulness, and community accountability. It offers habit streak tracking, 
meditation, a supportive in-app community, and a browser extension to block adult content at the source.

> ## Project Goals

The core objectives of **HoldX** were:

- To provide an effective support system for individuals battling porn addiction through structured tools and a healthy community.
- To encourage user commitment via streak tracking, achievements, and pledge systems.
- To enable long-term behavior change through features like guided meditation, relapse prevention, and breathing exercises.
- To integrate content-blocking functionality with a browser extension for deeper habit control.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

HoldX was built as a **solo project** from the ground up for both iOS and Android platforms. One of the 
biggest challenges was integrating multiple engagement features (like AI chat, browser blocking, and community 
tools) without compromising app performance. Managing state efficiently, especially across streaks, chat, 
and notifications, pushed me to refine my architecture skills. Through consistent iteration, Sentry monitoring, 
and community feedback, I fine-tuned the user experience to be empowering and non-judgmental.

> ## Lessons Learned

Building HoldX from scratch taught me what it means to create something that truly matters. Through the 
development of HoldX, I deepened my expertise in mobile architecture and scalable state management, ensuring 
the app remained responsive and efficient across both iOS and Android platforms. I navigated the full deployment 
cycle, from testing to publishing on the App Store and Play Store, while integrating robust analytics and error 
tracking using Singular and Sentry. I also explored user retention strategies grounded in behavioral psychology 
to foster habit change and long-term engagement. Most importantly, I learned how to build a secure and empathetic 
digital space that respects user privacy and supports individuals navigating sensitive personal challenges.
