> ## Features

### Ambulance Calling with Map Integration

Users can easily call an ambulance using the app, with integrated map functionality for precise location tracking.

### Chat Feature

An in-app chat feature for clear and immediate communication during health emergencies.

### Barcode Scanner

Allows users to quickly scan barcodes to access patient or doctor information, streamlining the process during emergencies.

### Health Infographics and Memo Feature

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Integrating the barcode scanner was a challenge that I overcame by researching solutions through YouTube tutorials 
and consulting with experienced individuals to implement the feature effectively. To ensure smooth functionality for 
all features in the health-focused app, I focused on seamlessly integrating multiple features, such as chat and maps, 
ensuring users could access everything they needed in an emergency. For designing a user-friendly interface for health 
information, I worked on creating intuitive layouts and providing easy access to critical emergency features.

> ## Lessons Learned

I gained valuable experience working with Firebase for backend integration and learned how to implement complex 
features like the barcode scanner and chat integration effectively. This process improved my problem-solving skills 
as I researched and learned from external resources such as YouTube and expert consultations. Additionally, I enhanced 
my ability to work collaboratively on a project, contributing new features to improve the app.
