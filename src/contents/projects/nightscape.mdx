> ## Short Explanation

Nightscape is an action-packed monster shooter game developed in Unity, where players survive waves of increasingly 
difficult monsters and purchase upgrades to enhance their weapons and character strength.

> ## Project Goals

The main goals of Nightscape were:

- To develop an engaging and fun shooter game that challenges players with escalating difficulty.
- To learn and apply Unity game development skills, including asset creation, game mechanics, and user interface design.
- To build a rewarding experience where playersâ€™ survival skills are tested through progressively harder waves of enemies.

- Game Engine: Unity
- Languages: C#
- Assets Creation: Custom 2D/3D assets (created using external tools)

> ## Features

### Wave-Based Gameplay

Players face waves of monsters, with difficulty increasing after each wave.

### Weapon Upgrades

At the end of each wave, players can purchase new weapons to boost their chances of survival.

### Scoring System

Players earn points based on how long they survive, with higher scores reflecting better performance.

### Challenging AI

Monsters become progressively stronger with each wave, creating an ever-increasing challenge for the player.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Designing and creating game assets from scratch was a challenge, which I overcame by using free asset libraries 
and learning to create custom assets in external tools. Implementing smooth and challenging game mechanics required 
balancing monster difficulty, weapon upgrades, and game progression to ensure an engaging and fair gameplay experience. 
To maintain stable performance as the game grew more complex, I optimized game logic and asset management, ensuring 
smooth gameplay even with more objects on screen.

> ## Lessons Learned

I gained valuable experience in Unity and C# programming for game development and learned that creating a game 
becomes much more manageable when broken down into smaller tasks. I improved my skills in asset creation and 
integrating them into Unity, and discovered the importance of balancing gameplay difficulty to ensure player 
engagement and satisfaction. The project resulted in a strong sense of accomplishment, as my lecturer awarded full 
marks for my work.
