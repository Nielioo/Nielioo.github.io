> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Charo AI was my second project at Saclic Studio, and I was more confident compared to my first project. However, 
working on a project of this complexity still presented challenges. Integrating AI-driven features like photo analysis 
and chat topic generation required a deep understanding of how to use the OpenAI API effectively. Additionally, 
implementing the in-app purchase system was new to me and demanded careful attention to detail to ensure a smooth 
user experience.

> ## Lessons Learned

Through Charo AI, I expanded my knowledge of integrating AI technologies with mobile apps and gained valuable experience 
in implementing monetization strategies through in-app purchases. The project helped me refine my skills in mobile app
development and further solidified my understanding of Flutter and Dart. Overall, I grew both technically and 
professionally, making this project a significant milestone in my career.
