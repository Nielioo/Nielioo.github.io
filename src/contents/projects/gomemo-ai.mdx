> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

This was my first project at Saclic Studio, marking a significant transition from university assignments to 
the professional working environment. Adjusting to the demands of real-world tasks was initially challenging but 
also enriching. I needed to learn new technologies, such as using Python for backend development, and I had to deploy 
the API using Docker, which was entirely new to me. Setting up the server and ensuring it was functional presented a 
steep learning curve, especially during the initial stages of server configuration. However, through persistence, 
research, and guidance from my superior, I was able to overcome these challenges and successfully deploy the API.

> ## Lessons Learned

Working on GoMemo AI taught me valuable lessons, not only in technical skills but also in professional communication. 
I gained a deeper understanding of how to collaborate with my boss and team members effectively. Additionally, I improved 
my proficiency with Python, Docker, and API deployment, which are now essential components of my skill set. This project 
provided a holistic learning experience, preparing me for future challenges in the tech industry.
