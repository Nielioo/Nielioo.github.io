> ## Short Explanation

Windrise is an iOS app serving as a comprehensive database for Genshin Impact, showcasing characters, 
weapons, and artifacts in a user-friendly format.

> ## Project Goals

The primary objectives of Windrise were:

- To create an accessible and detailed database app for Genshin Impact enthusiasts.
- To learn and apply SwiftUI for iOS app development.
- To demonstrate creativity and technical skills as part of the journey toward applying to the Apple Developer Academy.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

One challenge was learning SwiftUI from scratch within a limited time, which I addressed by 
dedicating time to tutorials, documentation, and hands-on practice while building Windrise. Another 
challenge was working within the constraints of limited access to a MacBook, which I managed efficiently 
during the semester-long loan period from Universitas Ciputra. Additionally, designing a beginner-friendly 
interface for Genshin Impact fans was addressed by focusing on an organized layout with clear navigation and 
visual hierarchy, leveraging SwiftUI's declarative syntax.

> ## Lessons Learned

I gained foundational knowledge and hands-on experience with SwiftUI and iOS app development, learning 
how to design and implement a database-driven app effectively. Through this process, I discovered the importance 
of time management when working with limited resources and solidified my passion for iOS development, which inspired 
me to apply to the Apple Developer Academy to further refine my skills.
