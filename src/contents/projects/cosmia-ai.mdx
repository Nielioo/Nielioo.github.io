### Referral System and In-App Purchases

Users can unlock premium features through in-app purchases or gain free access by using a referral code system.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Cosmia AI was my fourth project at Saclic Studio, and I built it independently from scratch. The app required designing 
a versatile chat system to handle multiple topics seamlessly, which was a significant challenge. Ensuring the advice 
generated by the AI was meaningful and engaging while maintaining a smooth user experience added complexity. Additionally, 
integrating the referral system and in-app purchases involved precise implementation to avoid any bugs. To overcome these 
challenges, I relied on my experience from previous projects, thoroughly tested every feature, and iterated designs based 
on user feedback.

> ## Lessons Learned

Working on Cosmia AI was a transformative experience, as it strengthened my ability to independently manage a complex 
project. I deepened my expertise in integrating AI-powered features into mobile apps and learned how to create a robust 
chat system capable of handling diverse user inputs. This project also emphasized the importance of user-centric design 
and reinforced my ability to balance creativity with technical implementation.
